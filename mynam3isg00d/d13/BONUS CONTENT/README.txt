Generator for encoded messages in day 13 form
NOTES:
1 only letters ("a-z") and space (" ") are convertable. I don't know what happens for other chars lol
2 I use a custom letter alphabet made with my own ascii 
3 It's possibile to input as many characters as one chooses
4 Because of notes 2 and 3 it's possible that creases are not where they're supposed to be following
  the aoc input standard. Make your code more general :^) (mine works if you can't be bothered)
5 cool
